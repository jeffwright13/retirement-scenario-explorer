          "introduction": "I was in Stage 1 of the competence model - I didn't know what I didn't know. Looking at my $918K portfolio, I felt pretty confident about retirement. Classic unconscious incompetence.",
          "setup": "This uses my real data: $70K in savings, $513K in investments, $323K in Traditional IRA, and $12K in Roth IRA. I'll show you the 0% inflation scenario that made me feel secure - back when I didn't know inflation was the silent killer.",

            "Stage 1: I didn't know what I didn't know about inflation",
            "This is my actual portfolio: $918K felt like 'enough' until I did the math",

          "introduction": "Adding realistic 3.5% inflation to the exact same portfolio launched me into Stage 2 - suddenly I knew what I didn't know. This was my conscious incompetence moment.",
          "setup": "Same portfolio, same expenses, same returns - but now with 3.5% inflation. Nothing else changed. This is when I realized I had a massive blind spot in my retirement planning.",

            "SAME portfolio but realistic inflation - money runs out in year {{duration_years}}",
            "Inflation cuts my retirement timeline by YEARS, not months",
