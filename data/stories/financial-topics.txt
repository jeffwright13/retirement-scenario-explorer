Based on your journey so far, here are the critical knowledge gaps that separate DIY investors from CFP-level expertise:

🎯 Tax Optimization (The Biggest Gap)

Roth conversion ladders - Converting traditional IRA to Roth in low-tax years
Tax location - Which assets go in which account types
Tax-loss harvesting - Offsetting gains with losses
Asset allocation across account types - Not just total allocation
State tax considerations - Moving to tax-friendly states

🏥 Healthcare & Long-Term Care (The Scariest Gap)

Medicare supplement planning - Parts A, B, C, D, Medigap
Long-term care costs - $100k+/year, not covered by Medicare
Health Savings Account strategies - Triple tax advantage in retirement
COBRA vs ACA vs Medicare timing - Critical 2-year bridge period
Long-term care insurance - When to buy, hybrid policies

📊 Advanced Withdrawal Strategies (Beyond 4% Rule)

Variable withdrawal strategies - Guardrails, floor-ceiling
Bond tents - De-risking as you approach/enter retirement
Bucket strategies - 1-3 year cash, bonds, stocks
Sequence of returns risk - Why early years matter most
Dynamic asset allocation - Adjusting based on market conditions

💰 Social Security Optimization (Complex!)

Spousal claiming strategies - File and suspend (eliminated), restricted application
Do-over strategies - Withdraw and re-file
Working in retirement - Earnings test, tax implications
Medicare Part B timing - Avoiding penalties when delaying SS

🏛️ Estate & Legacy Planning

Beneficiary designations - Often more important than wills
Stretch provisions - SECURE Act changes to inherited IRAs
Revocable vs irrevocable trusts - When you need them
Power of attorney - Financial and healthcare
Charitable giving strategies - QCD, donor-advised funds

🧠 Behavioral Finance (The Hidden Killer)

Sequence of returns anxiety - How to not panic-sell in crashes
Spending flexibility - Which expenses can you cut?
Longevity planning - What if you live to 95?
Cognitive decline planning - Who takes over decisions?
