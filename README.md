# 💰 retirement-scenario-explorer

📈 A browser-based tool for modeling and visualizing retirement financial scenarios. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inputs are scenario definitions in JSON format; outputs include dynamic charts showing cash flow, drawdowns, and asset balances over time. Designed to be composable, testable, and fully client-side.

A lightweight, browser-based tool for modeling and visualizing **retirement financial scenarios**. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no backend, no installs.

## 🌟 Features

- Accepts input as structured JSON (e.g. assets, withdrawals, income)
- Dynamically computes projections over time
- Renders interactive charts (e.g., cash flow, asset drawdown)
- Modular and testable JavaScript logic
- Fully client-side — works offline, deployable via GitHub Pages
- Simple UI with clean separation between logic and presentation

## 🧠 Modeling Real-Life Retirement Scenarios

The `retirement-scenario-explorer` uses a streamlined but powerful financial simulation model. While it does not currently support a separate `events[]` or `phases[]` system, it can model **complex real-life situations** using only:

- `assets[]` – accounts, reserves, windfalls, and even negative-balance shocks
- `income[]` – steady or phased monthly income streams
- `plan.monthly_expenses` – base living costs

Everything else can be expressed through these primitives.

### ✅ Common Scenarios and How to Model Them

#### 📦 Inheritance or Lump Sum Windfall
```json
{
  "name": "Inherited Trust",
  "type": "taxable",
  "balance": 250000,
  "start_month": 60,
  "interest_rate": 0.04
}
```

#### 🏠 Home Sale (one-time deposit)
```json
{
  "name": "Home Sale Proceeds",
  "type": "taxable",
  "balance": 180000,
  "start_month": 120
}
```

#### 🔧 Roof Replacement (one-time expense)
```json
{
  "name": "Roof Replacement",
  "type": "taxable",
  "balance": -25000,
  "start_month": 150
}
```

#### 🆘 Emergency Fund (fallback source)
```json
{
  "name": "Emergency Fund",
  "type": "taxable",
  "balance": 50000,
  "interest_rate": 0.00
}
```

#### 🧑‍💼 Variable or Phased Income (multiple entries)
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Part-Time Work",
    "amount": 2000,
    "start_month": 0,
    "stop_month": 12
  },
  {
    "name": "Part-Time Work",
    "amount": 1500,
    "start_month": 13,
    "stop_month": 24
  }
]
```

#### 🐶 Getting a Dog (startup and recurring cost)
```json
{
  "name": "Dog Setup",
  "type": "taxable",
  "balance": -2000,
  "start_month": 36
}
```

(Recurring monthly costs should be added into `monthly_expenses` manually or approximated as a drawdown margin.)

### 🧩 Key Insight

> **Everything is an asset.**  
> Windfalls, one-time expenses, future accounts, emergency reserves — they can all be expressed as time-aware `assets[]` with either positive or negative balances and flexible interest behavior.

This flexible design avoids the need for separate `events[]`, `liabilities[]`, or `shocks[]` sections — while remaining easy to understand, test, and extend.

---

### 🛠 Future Feature Ideas (Not Yet Implemented)

- Support for `monthly_expenses[]` as time-varying intervals
- Scenario branching (optimistic vs pessimistic paths)
- Asset liquidity constraints or early withdrawal penalties
- Tax treatment simulation (pre-tax, Roth, capital gains)

## 🔄 Processing Loop Overview

The core simulation is implemented as a monthly loop that progresses through the entire duration of the retirement plan.

### Pseudocode Summary:
```javascript
for each month in duration:
    1. Sum income for this month
    2. Subtract expenses to determine shortfall
    3. Withdraw funds from assets using drawdown order
    4. Apply interest growth to all assets
    5. Record state (balances, income, shortfall) for this month
```

Each asset may have:
- A `start_month` that determines when it becomes active
- A balance that grows monthly (if `interest_rate` > 0)
- A withdrawal limit of the current balance

CSV output and charts are generated based on these monthly records.
