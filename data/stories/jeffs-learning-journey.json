        "introduction": "For 30 years, I thought retirement planning meant work hard and save into a 401k. That was it. I was too busy working toward retirement to actually figure out what retirement really meant. I had accumulated $918,000 in assets over the decades – almost a million dollars! And those Fisher Investment ads were always saying you could retire comfortably on that, right?\n\nThen life happened all at once. I was diagnosed with a degenerative neurological disease. I got laid off for the first time in my 30-year career – no more paycheck. A month later, what was supposed to be a simple outpatient surgical procedure went sideways, landing me in the ER, then laid up in the hospital for almost two weeks. Lying there, unable to move, and with nothing but time to think, I finally started to take stock of my financial reality, and how it might play out in my golden years.\n\nMy initial thought was simple division: $918,000 divided by my $8,500 monthly expenses meant about 9 years of money. Terrifying, but at least I knew where I stood.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nWhat I discovered next shattered everything I believed about retirement planning. Each assumption I made was wrong in a different way. Each 'fix' revealed multiple new problems I'd never even considered. I thought I was prepared. I wasn't even close. Let me show you what I learned, one devastating revelation at a time."

            "introduction": "This is how I first modeled retirement - assets that earn absolutely nothing. Just a pile of money that shrinks by exactly $8,500 every month. Simple math, right? Divide total assets by monthly expenses. Easy!",
