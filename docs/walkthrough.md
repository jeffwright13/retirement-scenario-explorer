## üß† The Core Process

Before we dive into examples, let's understand what happens **every single month** in the simulation:

```
üìÖ Month N:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Add any income for this month (Social Security, part-time work, etc.)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate shortfall: monthly_expenses - income
3Ô∏è‚É£ If shortfall > 0: withdraw from assets (in priority order) to cover it
4Ô∏è‚É£ Apply monthly interest growth to all remaining asset balances
5Ô∏è‚É£ Record everything (income, expenses, withdrawals, new balances)
6Ô∏è‚É£ Move to next month and repeat
```

This simple loop runs for however many months you specify (`duration_months`), creating a complete financial projection.

## üìñ Chapter 1: The Simplest Possible Case

Let's start with a retiree who has no income and just one savings account.

**Scenario**: Sarah has $120,000 in savings earning 2% annually. She needs $3,000/month to live.

```json
{
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 3000, 
    "duration_months": 48 
  },
  "income": [],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Savings",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 120000,
      "interest_rate": 0.02,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What happens month by month?**

- **Month 1**: Income = $0, Shortfall = $3,000
  - Withdraw $3,000 from Savings ‚Üí Balance: $117,000
  - Apply interest: $117,000 √ó (1 + 0.02/12) = $117,195
- **Month 2**: Income = $0, Shortfall = $3,000  
  - Withdraw $3,000 from Savings ‚Üí Balance: $114,195
  - Apply interest: $114,195 √ó 1.00167 = $114,385
- **Month 3**: Repeat...

**Key Insight**: Even with 2% growth, Sarah is withdrawing $3,000 but only earning ~$190/month in interest. Her balance drops by ~$2,810 net each month.

**Expected Outcome**: Sarah's money will last about 43-44 months (not quite 4 years).

## üìñ Chapter 2: Adding Income Changes Everything

Now let's see what happens when Sarah gets Social Security.

**Scenario**: Same Sarah, but Social Security of $1,800/month starts in month 12.

```json
{
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 3000, 
    "duration_months": 48 
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security",
      "amount": 1800,
      "start_month": 12
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Savings",
      "type": "taxable", 
      "balance": 120000,
      "interest_rate": 0.02,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What changes?**

- **Months 1-11**: Same as before - withdrawing $3,000/month
- **Month 12 onward**: Income = $1,800, Shortfall = only $1,200
  - Now only withdrawing $1,200/month instead of $3,000
  - Asset depletion slows dramatically

**Expected Outcome**: Sarah's money will last much longer - probably 15+ years instead of 3.5 years.

**Key Insight**: Income timing matters enormously. Starting Social Security even 1 year earlier could extend her financial runway by years.

## üìñ Chapter 3: Multiple Assets and Withdrawal Priority

Real retirees have multiple accounts. Let's see how priority-based withdrawals work.

**Scenario**: Bob has both a savings account and a higher-growth investment account. He wants to preserve the investments as long as possible.

```json
{
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 4000, 
    "duration_months": 120 
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security", 
      "amount": 2200,
      "start_month": 24
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Savings",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 50000,
      "interest_rate": 0.015,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Investment Account", 
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 200000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {"account": "Savings", "order": 1},
    {"account": "Investment Account", "order": 2}
  ]
}
```

**What happens?**

- **Months 1-23**: Need $4,000/month, no income
  - Priority 1: Drain "Savings" first ($50k √∑ $4k = ~12.5 months)
  - Priority 2: Then start hitting "Investment Account"
- **Month 24+**: Social Security kicks in, shortfall drops to $1,800/month
  - Investment account depletion slows way down

**Key Insight**: The `order` array lets you implement realistic withdrawal strategies. Common approaches:
- Spend cash/savings first (lower growth)
- Preserve tax-advantaged accounts longest (Roth IRA last)
- Spend taxable accounts before tax-deferred accounts

## üìñ Chapter 4: Life Events as Assets

This is where the model gets clever. Life events (windfalls, expenses, inheritances) are just "assets" that activate at specific times.

**Scenario**: Carol gets an inheritance in year 5, but also has a major home repair in year 3.

```json
{
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 5000, 
    "duration_months": 180 
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security",
      "amount": 2800, 
      "start_month": 36
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Brokerage",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 300000,
      "interest_rate": 0.05,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Roof Replacement",
      "type": "taxable", 
      "balance": -25000,
      "start_month": 36
    },
    {
      "name": "Inheritance",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 150000,
      "start_month": 60,
      "interest_rate": 0.04,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What happens?**

- **Months 1-35**: Withdrawing $5,000/month from Brokerage
- **Month 36**: 
  - Social Security starts (+$2,800 income)
  - Roof replacement hits (-$25,000 one-time expense)
  - Net shortfall for this month: $5,000 - $2,800 + $25,000 = $27,200
- **Months 37-59**: Normal $2,200/month shortfall
- **Month 60**: Inheritance arrives (+$150,000 to available assets)
- **Month 61+**: Now has two growing assets to draw from

**Key Insights**: 
- Negative balances model one-time expenses
- `start_month` lets you time events precisely
- Multiple assets can have different growth rates (inheritance might be more conservative)

## üìñ Chapter 5: Complex Real-World Scenario

Let's put it all together with a realistic case similar to your situation.

**Scenario**: Dave, 60, was recently laid off. Considering early retirement vs. job hunting.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Dave's Early Retirement Analysis",
    "notes": "Laid off at 60, evaluating early retirement feasibility"
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 7500,
    "duration_months": 300
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Consulting Work",
      "amount": 3000,
      "start_month": 6,
      "stop_month": 18
    },
    {
      "name": "Social Security",
      "amount": 2400,
      "start_month": 24
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Emergency Fund",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 40000,
      "interest_rate": 0.01,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Taxable Investments", 
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 450000,
      "interest_rate": 0.055,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Traditional 401k",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 380000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Roth IRA",
      "type": "tax_free", 
      "balance": 75000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Car Replacement",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": -35000,
      "start_month": 84
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {"account": "Emergency Fund", "order": 1},
    {"account": "Taxable Investments", "order": 2}, 
    {"account": "Traditional 401k", "order": 3},
    {"account": "Roth IRA", "order": 4}
  ]
}
```

**This models**:
- **Immediate situation**: Living off emergency fund initially
- **Bridge income**: Some consulting work for 1 year to ease transition  
- **Social Security timing**: Starting at 62 (24 months from now)
- **Asset priority**: Spend taxable first, preserve Roth longest
- **Future expense**: Car replacement in 7 years
- **Growth assumptions**: Different rates for different asset types

**Expected questions this answers**:
- Can Dave make it 25 years without returning to full-time work?
- How much does delaying Social Security to 67 help?
- What if consulting income is higher/lower/longer?
- How sensitive is the plan to market performance?

## üéØ Next Steps

Now that you understand the progression from simple to complex:

1. **Start simple**: Model your basic situation first
2. **Add complexity gradually**: Layer in income timing, multiple assets, life events
3. **Test variations**: Change Social Security timing, asset allocation, expense levels
4. **Stress test**: What if market returns are lower? Expenses higher?

The beauty of this model is that **everything is an asset that appears at some time with some growth rate**. This simple abstraction can model incredibly complex real-life scenarios.

**Remember**: This is a projection tool, not a crystal ball. Use it to understand trends, test scenarios, and make informed decisions - but always plan for uncertainty!

## üîß Pro Tips

- **Month numbering**: The tool uses 0-based indexing internally (month 0 = first month), but displays 1-based in CSV (Month 1, 2, 3...)
- **Interest compounding**: Monthly compounding means annual rate √∑ 12, applied each month
- **Withdrawal logic**: Assets are drained completely in priority order before moving to the next priority
- **CSV export**: Great for further analysis in spreadsheets - you can create your own charts, pivot tables, etc.
