## üìö Retirement Scenario Explorer Learning Path

### Level 0 ‚Äî Orientation
1. **[Chapter 1 ‚Äî Welcome & Orientation](../data/discussions/01-intro.md)**  
   Get familiar with the tool‚Äôs interface and run your first positive-cash-flow scenario.  
   - Introduces JSON structure  
   - Runs with no inflation, one asset, fixed salary  

2. **[Chapter 2 ‚Äî Budgeting 101](../data/discussions/02-budgeting.md)**  
   Learn fixed vs. variable expenses and simulate realistic monthly budgets.

---

### Level 1 ‚Äî Core Financial Concepts
3. **Inflation Basics** ‚Äî `/data/discussions/inflation-basics.md`  
   Model how inflation affects purchasing power over decades.

4. **Assets & Growth**  
   Add investment accounts and see how compounding works with different return rates.

5. **Income Streams**  
   Add Social Security, pensions, or part-time work with defined start/stop months.

---

### Level 2 ‚Äî Planning for Real Life
6. **One-Time Events**  
   Inheritances, large purchases, or medical bills.

7. **Sequence of Returns Risk** ‚Äî `/data/discussions/sequence-returns.md`  
   How market timing affects your plan even if average returns look fine.

8. **Early Retirement** ‚Äî `/data/discussions/early-retirement.md`  
   Simulate retiring years earlier than planned and see the effects.

---

### Level 3 ‚Äî Advanced Modeling
9. **Tax-Aware Withdrawals**  
   Compare taxable-first vs. tax-deferred-first drawdown strategies.

10. **Multi-Scenario Comparisons**  
    Clone and tweak scenarios to run side-by-side.

11. **Stress Testing**  
    Simulate recessions, high-inflation decades, or unexpected expenses.

---

**Tip:** Every chapter links to:
- A `.json` scenario in `/data/scenarios/`
- A `.md` discussion in `/data/discussions/`
So you can **read ‚Üí run ‚Üí modify** for each concept.

## üß† How the Simulation Works

Every month, the simulation follows this simple process:

```
üìÖ Month N:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Add any income for this month (Social Security, part-time work, etc.)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate shortfall: monthly_expenses - income
3Ô∏è‚É£ If shortfall > 0: withdraw from assets (in priority order) to cover it
4Ô∏è‚É£ Apply monthly interest growth to all remaining asset balances
5Ô∏è‚É£ Record everything (income, expenses, withdrawals, new balances)
6Ô∏è‚É£ Move to next month and repeat
```

This loop runs for however many months you specify (`duration_months`), creating a complete financial projection.

## üìñ Level 1: The Simplest Case

**Scenario**: Sarah has $120,000 in savings earning 2% annually. She needs $3,000/month to live.

```json
{
  "example": {
    "metadata": {
      "title": "Level 1: Simple Drawdown",
      "description": "Sarah has $120k in savings earning 2% annually. She needs $3,000/month to live. How long will her money last?"
    },
    "plan": {
      "monthly_expenses": 3000,
      "duration_months": 48,
      "inflation_schedule": "example_no_inflation"
    },
    "income": [],
    "assets": [
      {
        "name": "Savings",
        "type": "taxable",
        "balance": 120000,
        "compounding": "monthly",
        "return_schedule": "example_Savings_returns"
      }
    ],
    "order": [
      {
        "account": "Savings",
        "order": 1
      }
    ],
    "rate_schedules": {
      "example_no_inflation": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.0
      },
      "example_Savings_returns": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.02
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What happens month by month:**
- **Month 1**: Income = $0, Shortfall = $3,000 ‚Üí Withdraw $3,000 ‚Üí Balance: $117,000 ‚Üí Apply interest: $117,195
- **Month 2**: Income = $0, Shortfall = $3,000 ‚Üí Withdraw $3,000 ‚Üí Balance: $114,195 ‚Üí Apply interest: $114,385
- **And so on...**

**Key Insight**: Even with 2% growth, Sarah withdraws $3,000 but only earns ~$190/month in interest. Net loss: ~$2,810/month.

**Expected Outcome**: Money lasts about 43-44 months (not quite 4 years).

---

## üìñ Level 2: Income Changes Everything

Same Sarah, but Social Security starts in month 12.

```json
{
  "example": {
    "metadata": {
      "title": "Level 2: Adding Social Security",
      "description": "Same Sarah, but Social Security of $1,800/month starts in month 6. Watch the dramatic change in sustainability!"
    },
    "plan": {
      "monthly_expenses": 3000,
      "duration_months": 104,
      "inflation_schedule": "example_no_inflation"
    },
    "income": [
      {
        "name": "Social Security",
        "amount": 1800,
        "start_month": 6
      }
    ],
    "assets": [
      {
        "name": "Savings",
        "type": "taxable",
        "balance": 120000,
        "compounding": "monthly",
        "return_schedule": "example_Savings_returns"
      }
    ],
    "order": [
      {
        "account": "Savings",
        "order": 1
      }
    ],
    "rate_schedules": {
      "example_no_inflation": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.0
      },
      "example_Savings_returns": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.02
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What changes:**
- **Months 1-11**: Same as before - withdrawing $3,000/month
- **Month 12 onward**: Income = $1,800, Shortfall = only $1,200 ‚Üí Withdrawing $1,200/month instead of $3,000

**Expected Outcome**: Money lasts 8+ years instead of 3.5 years.

## üìñ Level 3: Multiple Assets and Withdrawal Strategy

Real retirees have multiple accounts with different characteristics.

```json
{
  "example": {
    "metadata": {
      "title": "Level 3: Multiple Assets and Withdrawal Priority",
      "description": "Bob has savings and investments. He wants to preserve the higher-growth investments as long as possible by spending savings first."
    },
    "plan": {
      "monthly_expenses": 4000,
      "duration_months": 168,
      "inflation_schedule": "example_no_inflation"
    },
    "income": [
      {
        "name": "Social Security",
        "amount": 2200,
        "start_month": 24
      }
    ],
    "assets": [
      {
        "name": "Savings",
        "type": "taxable",
        "balance": 50000,
        "compounding": "monthly",
        "return_schedule": "example_Savings_returns"
      },
      {
        "name": "Investment Account",
        "type": "taxable",
        "balance": 200000,
        "compounding": "monthly",
        "return_schedule": "example_Investment_Account_returns"
      }
    ],
    "order": [
      {
        "account": "Savings",
        "order": 1
      },
      {
        "account": "Investment Account",
        "order": 2
      }
    ],
    "rate_schedules": {
      "example_no_inflation": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.0
      },
      "example_Savings_returns": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.015
      },
      "example_Investment_Account_returns": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.06
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**What happens:**
- **Months 1-23**: Need $4,000/month, no income
  - **Priority 1**: Drain "Savings" first ($50k √∑ $4k = ~12.5 months)
  - **Priority 2**: Then start hitting "Investment Account"
- **Month 24+**: Social Security kicks in ‚Üí shortfall drops to $1,800/month

**Key Insight**: The `order` array implements withdrawal strategies:
- Spend cash/savings first (lower growth potential)
- Preserve high-growth investments longer
- Tax-optimized strategies (taxable before tax-deferred, Roth IRA last)

## üìñ Level 4: Modeling Large Expenses

If you you want to nodel large future expenses, use individual `income` entries, and give them a `stop_month` after defining their `start_month`.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Level 4: Two Large Expenses",
    "notes": "Carol anticipates a major home repair in years 3 (-$15k for a new kichen, paid all at once) and 5 (-$45k for a new roof, paid over three months)."
  },
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 5000, 
    "duration_months": 180 
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security",
      "amount": 2800, 
      "start_month": 12
    },
    {
      "name": "Kitchen",
      "amount": -15000,
      "start_month": 36,
      "stop_month": 36
    },
    {
      "name": "Roof",
      "amount": -15000,
      "start_month": 60,
      "stop_month": 62
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Brokerage",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 300000,
      "interest_rate": 0.05,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
    // {
    //   "name": "Roof Replacement",
    //   "type": "taxable", 
    //   "balance": -25000,
    //   "start_month": 36
    // },
    // {
    //   "name": "Inheritance",
    //   "type": "taxable",
    //   "balance": 150000,
    //   "start_month": 60,
    //   "interest_rate": 0.04,
    //   "compounding": "monthly"
    // }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Brokerage",
      "order": 1
    }
    // {
    //   "account": "Inheritance",
    //   "order": 2
    // }
  ]
}
```

**What happens:**
- **Months 1-35**: Withdrawing $5,000/month from Brokerage
- **Month 36**: 
  - Social Security starts (+$2,800 income)
  - Roof replacement hits (-$25,000 one-time expense)
  - **Net shortfall this month**: $5,000 - $2,800 + $25,000 = $27,200
- **Months 37-59**: Normal $2,200/month shortfall
- **Month 60**: Inheritance arrives (+$150,000 available for withdrawal)
- **Month 61+**: Two growing assets to draw from

**Key Insights**: 
- **Negative balances** model one-time expenses
- **`start_month`** times events precisely
- **Multiple assets** can have different growth rates

## üí∞ Social Security Strategy Analysis

One of the biggest retirement decisions is **when to claim Social Security**. Let's model the three main strategies:

### Strategy A: Claim Early at Age 62 (75% of full benefit)

```json
{
  "example": {
    "metadata": {
      "title": "SS Strategy A: Claim at Age 62",
      "description": "Maria claims early: $2,100/month (75% of full benefit) starting at age 62. Lower monthly benefit but immediate cash flow."
    },
    "plan": {
      "monthly_expenses": 6500,
      "duration_months": 360,
      "inflation_schedule": "example_no_inflation"
    },
    "income": [
      {
        "name": "Social Security (Early)",
        "amount": 2100,
        "start_month": 24
      }
    ],
    "assets": [
      {

        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.055
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Strategy B: Wait Until Full Retirement Age (67)

```json
{
  "example": {
    "metadata": {
      "title": "SS Strategy B: Claim at Full Retirement Age (67)",
      "description": "Maria waits for full benefit: $2,800/month (100%) starting at age 67. More asset depletion early, but higher lifetime benefit."
    },
    "plan": {
      "monthly_expenses": 6500,

        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.055
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Strategy C: Delay Until Age 70 (132% of full benefit)

```json
{
  "example": {
    "metadata": {
      "title": "SS Strategy C: Delay Until Age 70",
      "description": "Maria delays for maximum benefit: $3,696/month (132%) starting at age 70. Highest monthly benefit but maximum early asset depletion."
    },
    "plan": {
      "monthly_expenses": 6500,
      "duration_months": 360,
      "inflation_schedule": "example_no_inflation"
    },
    "income": [
      {
        "name": "Social Security (Delayed)",
        "amount": 3696,

        "balance": 200000,
        "compounding": "monthly",
        "return_schedule": "example_Taxable_Investments_returns"
      }
    ],
    "order": [
      {
        "account": "Taxable Investments",
        "order": 1
      },
      {
        "account": "401k/IRA",
        "order": 2
      }
    ],
    "rate_schedules": {
      "example_no_inflation": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.0
      },
      "example_401k/IRA_returns": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.06
      },
      "example_Taxable_Investments_returns": {
        "type": "fixed",
        "rate": 0.055
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Monthly Draw After SS | Early Asset Depletion | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Age 62   | $4,400              | $156,000 (2 years)   | Lower      |
| Age 67   | $3,700              | $546,000 (7 years)   | Medium     |
| Age 70   | $2,804              | $780,000 (10 years)  | Higher     |

**Analysis**: Run all three scenarios and compare the asset balance curves. The "best" strategy depends on:
- Life expectancy (break-even typically around age 80-84)
- Risk tolerance (early markets crashes hurt delayed strategies more)
- Other income sources
- Health considerations

## üè• Social Security Disability Decision Analysis

For those with health issues, SSDI can be life-changing financially.

### Scenario A: SSDI Approved

```json

}
```

**Key Insights:**
- **SSDI approval** = getting your full Social Security benefit 9 years early (huge financial win)
- **SSDI denial** forces difficult choices: reduced benefits or continued work with health limitations
- **Application process** takes 6+ months of living on assets

**This models:**
- **Immediate situation**: Living off emergency fund initially
- **Bridge income**: Some consulting for 1 year to ease transition  
- **Social Security timing**: Starting at 62 (realistic for layoff situation)
- **Asset priority**: Tax-efficient withdrawal sequence
- **Future expense**: Car replacement in 7 years
- **Growth assumptions**: Different rates for different asset types

## üéØ How to Use This Guide

### 1. Start Simple
Copy the Level 1 scenario and modify the numbers to match your basic situation.

### 2. Add Complexity Gradually
- Level 2: Add your income sources (Social Security, pensions, part-time work)
- Level 3: Model multiple accounts with withdrawal priorities
- Level 4: Add windfalls and major expenses

### 3. Compare Scenarios
Create variants to test:
- Different Social Security timing
- SSDI approval vs denial
- Various bridge strategies
- Optimistic vs pessimistic market returns

### 4. Stress Test
- What if returns are 2% lower?
- What if expenses are $500/month higher?
- What if a market crash happens in year 2-3?

### 5. Make Informed Decisions
Use the insights to:
- Choose Social Security timing
- Plan withdrawal strategies
- Build appropriate emergency reserves
- Decide on early retirement feasibility

---

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Everything is an asset** - Windfalls, expenses, future accounts can all be modeled as assets with timing and growth properties

2. **Timing matters enormously** - Small changes in Social Security timing or income duration can extend financial runway by years

3. **Withdrawal order affects outcomes** - Tax-efficient strategies preserve wealth longer

4. **Early years are critical** - Sequence of returns risk means early market crashes hurt more than later ones

5. **Income trumps assets** - Even small amounts of reliable income dramatically improve sustainability

## üöß Limitations to Remember

This tool shows **cash flow projections**, but doesn't model:
- **Tax implications** (withdrawals shown gross, not net)
- **Inflation** (expenses stay constant in real dollars)
- **Market volatility** (returns are smoothed monthly)
- **Required minimum distributions**
- **Healthcare cost changes**
- **Longevity uncertainty**

Use these scenarios as a **starting point** for deeper analysis with financial professionals.

---

## üîß Pro Tips

- **Month numbering**: Tool uses 0-based indexing (month 0 = first month)
- **Interest compounding**: Annual rate √∑ 12, applied monthly  
- **CSV export**: Great for spreadsheet analysis and custom charts
- **Order matters**: Assets drain completely in priority order
- **Negative balances**: Perfect for modeling one-time expenses
- **Start months**: Use to time events precisely
