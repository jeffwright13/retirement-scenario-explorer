      "introduction": "Many people think retirement planning is simple: work hard, save money, retire with enough assets. Done.\n\nThis assumption can be catastrophically wrong.\n\nConsider this common scenario: Someone approaches retirement with $940,000 in assets - nearly a million dollars! Financial commercials suggest you can 'retire comfortably' with that much, right?\n\nWith monthly expenses of $8,000, simple math suggests: $940,000 Ã· $8,000 = 117 months = about 10 years of money.\n\n*Ten years.*\n\nFor someone retiring at 60, this means being broke by 70. That can't be right... can it?\n\nWhat follows is a journey through the hidden complexities of retirement planning. Each time you think you've figured it out, you'll discover something that changes everything. Each 'solution' reveals new problems you never considered.\n\nThis is the progression from unconscious ignorance to financial reality - and eventually, to a workable plan. If you haven't done the detailed math on your own retirement... prepare to learn."

          "introduction": "Let's start with how I *actually* modeled retirement in my head for three decades. No growth. No compound interest. No inflation adjustments. Just a pile of money that shrinks by exactly $8,500 every month until it's gone.\n\nBecause honestly? I had no idea investment accounts keep growing while you withdraw from them. I treated retirement like a checking account.",
