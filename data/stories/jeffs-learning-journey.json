      "introduction": "For 30 years, I thought retirement planning was simple: work hard, save money in a 401k, retire with a million dollars. Done.\n\nI was catastrophically wrong.\n\nIn 2024, three life-changing events happened within months of each other. I was diagnosed with a degenerative neurological disease. I got laid off for the first time in my 30-year career. Then a routine surgical procedure went sideways, landing me in the hospital for two weeks.\n\nLying in that hospital bed, unable to move, with nothing but time to think, I finally did what I should have done decades ago: I actually calculated what retirement would look like.\n\nI had $918,000 in assets - nearly a million dollars! Those Fisher Investment commercials said I could 'retire comfortably' with that much, right?\n\nMy monthly expenses were $8,500. Simple math: $918,000 Ã· $8,500 = 108 months = 9 years of money.\n\n*Nine years.*\n\nI was 60 years old. My wife and I would be broke by 69. That couldn't be right... could it?\n\nWhat I discovered next shattered everything I thought I knew about money, investing, and retirement. Each time I thought I'd figured it out, I'd discover something that changed everything again. Each 'solution' revealed three new problems I'd never even considered.\n\nThis is the story of my journey from unconscious ignorance to painful reality - and maybe, eventually, to a workable plan. If you're reading this and haven't done the math on your own retirement... buckle up."

Just a pile of money that shrinks by exactly $8,500 every month until it's gone.\n\nBecause honestly? I had no idea investment accounts keep growing while you withdraw from them. I treated retirement like a checking account.",
