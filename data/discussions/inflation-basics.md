# The Silent Killer: Understanding Inflation

Inflation is the most underestimated threat to retirement security. Even "low" 3% inflation compounds relentlessly, creating a hidden tax on your future purchasing power.

## Why 3% Matters

At 3% annual inflation:
- Your expenses **double every 23 years**
- $5,200/month becomes $9,400 after 20 years  
- Your portfolio must earn 3% just to break even

## The Retirement Death Spiral

This is why inflation destroys retirement plans:

1. **Early years**: Small impact, easy to ignore
2. **Middle years**: Noticeable but manageable
3. **Later years**: Expenses explode while portfolio shrinks

## Historical Context

- **1970s**: Inflation hit 14% annually
- **2020s**: "Transitory" inflation lasted years
- **Your scenario**: Conservative 3% assumption

## The Compound Interest Flip Side

**Working FOR you**: $100 at 7% → $387 in 20 years  
**Working AGAINST you**: $5,200 expenses at 3% → $9,400 in 20 years

## Protection Strategies

- **TIPS bonds**: Government-guaranteed inflation protection
- **Equities**: Companies can raise prices with inflation  
- **Real estate**: Tangible assets tend to appreciate
- **Geographic arbitrage**: Move to lower-cost areas

## Try These Scenarios

- **"No Inflation"**: See the unrealistic baseline
- **"1970s High Inflation"**: The nightmare scenario
- **"Personal Portfolio"**: Real-world impact

*The difference between 0% and 3% inflation can cost you **9 years of retirement**.*
