# üéì Complete Retirement Scenario Modeling Guide

*A comprehensive step-by-step guide from basic concepts to advanced real-world modeling*

## üß† How the Simulation Works

Every month, the simulation follows this simple process:

```
üìÖ Month N:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Add any income for this month (Social Security, part-time work, etc.)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate shortfall: monthly_expenses - income
3Ô∏è‚É£ If shortfall > 0: withdraw from assets (in priority order) to cover it
4Ô∏è‚É£ Apply monthly interest growth to all remaining asset balances
5Ô∏è‚É£ Record everything (income, expenses, withdrawals, new balances)
6Ô∏è‚É£ Move to next month and repeat
```

This loop runs for however many months you specify (`duration_months`), creating a complete financial projection.

## üìñ Level 1: The Simplest Case

**Scenario**: Sarah has $120,000 in savings earning 2% annually. She needs $3,000/month to live.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Level 1: Simple Drawdown",
    "notes": "Sarah has $120k in savings earning 2% annually. She needs $3,000/month to live. How long will her money last?"
  },
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 3000, 
    "duration_months": 48 
  },
  "income": [],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Savings",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 120000,
      "interest_rate": 0.02,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Savings",
      "order": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**What happens month by month:**
- **Month 1**: Income = $0, Shortfall = $3,000 ‚Üí Withdraw $3,000 ‚Üí Balance: $117,000 ‚Üí Apply interest: $117,195
- **Month 2**: Income = $0, Shortfall = $3,000 ‚Üí Withdraw $3,000 ‚Üí Balance: $114,195 ‚Üí Apply interest: $114,385
- **And so on...**

**Key Insight**: Even with 2% growth, Sarah withdraws $3,000 but only earns ~$190/month in interest. Net loss: ~$2,810/month.

**Expected Outcome**: Money lasts about 43-44 months (not quite 4 years).

---

## üìñ Level 2: Income Changes Everything

Same Sarah, but Social Security starts in month 12.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Level 2: Adding Social Security",
    "notes": "Same Sarah, but Social Security of $1,800/month starts in month 6. Watch the dramatic change in sustainability!"
  },
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 3000, 
    "duration_months": 104
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security",
      "amount": 1800,
      "start_month": 6
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Savings",
      "type": "taxable", 
      "balance": 120000,
      "interest_rate": 0.02,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Savings",
      "order": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**What changes:**
- **Months 1-11**: Same as before - withdrawing $3,000/month
- **Month 12 onward**: Income = $1,800, Shortfall = only $1,200 ‚Üí Withdrawing $1,200/month instead of $3,000

**Expected Outcome**: Money lasts 8+ years instead of 3.5 years.

## üìñ Level 3: Multiple Assets and Withdrawal Strategy

Real retirees have multiple accounts with different characteristics.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Level 3: Multiple Assets and Withdrawal Priority",
    "notes": "Bob has savings and investments. He wants to preserve the higher-growth investments as long as possible by spending savings first."
  },
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 4000, 
    "duration_months": 168 
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security", 
      "amount": 2200,
      "start_month": 24
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Savings",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 50000,
      "interest_rate": 0.015,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Investment Account", 
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 200000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Savings",
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "Investment Account",
      "order": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**What happens:**
- **Months 1-23**: Need $4,000/month, no income
  - **Priority 1**: Drain "Savings" first ($50k √∑ $4k = ~12.5 months)
  - **Priority 2**: Then start hitting "Investment Account"
- **Month 24+**: Social Security kicks in ‚Üí shortfall drops to $1,800/month

**Key Insight**: The `order` array implements withdrawal strategies:
- Spend cash/savings first (lower growth potential)
- Preserve high-growth investments longer
- Tax-optimized strategies (taxable before tax-deferred, Roth IRA last)

---

## üìñ Level 4: Modeling Large Expenses

If you you want to nodel large future expenses, use individual `income` entries, and give them a `stop_month` after defining their `start_month`.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Level 4: Two Large Expenses",
    "notes": "Carol anticipates a major home repair in years 3 (-$15k for a new kichen, paid all at once) and 5 (-$45k for a new roof, paid over three months)."
  },
  "plan": { 
    "monthly_expenses": 5000, 
    "duration_months": 180 
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security",
      "amount": 2800, 
      "start_month": 12
    },
    {
      "name": "Kitchen",
      "amount": -15000,
      "start_month": 36,
      "stop_month": 36
    },
    {
      "name": "Roof",
      "amount": -15000,
      "start_month": 60,
      "stop_month": 62
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Brokerage",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 300000,
      "interest_rate": 0.05,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
    // {
    //   "name": "Roof Replacement",
    //   "type": "taxable", 
    //   "balance": -25000,
    //   "start_month": 36
    // },
    // {
    //   "name": "Inheritance",
    //   "type": "taxable",
    //   "balance": 150000,
    //   "start_month": 60,
    //   "interest_rate": 0.04,
    //   "compounding": "monthly"
    // }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Brokerage",
      "order": 1
    }
    // {
    //   "account": "Inheritance",
    //   "order": 2
    // }
  ]
}
```

**What happens:**
- **Months 1-35**: Withdrawing $5,000/month from Brokerage
- **Month 36**: 
  - Social Security starts (+$2,800 income)
  - Roof replacement hits (-$25,000 one-time expense)
  - **Net shortfall this month**: $5,000 - $2,800 + $25,000 = $27,200
- **Months 37-59**: Normal $2,200/month shortfall
- **Month 60**: Inheritance arrives (+$150,000 available for withdrawal)
- **Month 61+**: Two growing assets to draw from

**Key Insights**: 
- **Negative balances** model one-time expenses
- **`start_month`** times events precisely
- **Multiple assets** can have different growth rates

## üí∞ Social Security Strategy Analysis

One of the biggest retirement decisions is **when to claim Social Security**. Let's model the three main strategies:

### Strategy A: Claim Early at Age 62 (75% of full benefit)

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "SS Strategy A: Claim at Age 62",
    "notes": "Maria claims early: $2,100/month (75% of full benefit) starting at age 62. Lower monthly benefit but immediate cash flow."
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 6500,
    "duration_months": 360
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security (Early)",
      "amount": 2100,
      "start_month": 24
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "401k/IRA",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 450000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Taxable Investments",
      "type": "taxable", 
      "balance": 200000,
      "interest_rate": 0.055,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Taxable Investments",
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "401k/IRA",
      "order": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Strategy B: Wait Until Full Retirement Age (67)

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "SS Strategy B: Claim at Full Retirement Age (67)",
    "notes": "Maria waits for full benefit: $2,800/month (100%) starting at age 67. More asset depletion early, but higher lifetime benefit."
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 6500,
    "duration_months": 360
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security (Full)",
      "amount": 2800,
      "start_month": 84
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "401k/IRA",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 450000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Taxable Investments",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 200000,
      "interest_rate": 0.055,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Taxable Investments",
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "401k/IRA",
      "order": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Strategy C: Delay Until Age 70 (132% of full benefit)

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "SS Strategy C: Delay Until Age 70",
    "notes": "Maria delays for maximum benefit: $3,696/month (132%) starting at age 70. Highest monthly benefit but maximum early asset depletion."
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 6500,
    "duration_months": 360
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security (Delayed)",
      "amount": 3696,
      "start_month": 120
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "401k/IRA",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 450000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Taxable Investments",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 200000,
      "interest_rate": 0.055,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Taxable Investments",
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "401k/IRA",
      "order": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Monthly Draw After SS | Early Asset Depletion | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Age 62   | $4,400              | $156,000 (2 years)   | Lower      |
| Age 67   | $3,700              | $546,000 (7 years)   | Medium     |
| Age 70   | $2,804              | $780,000 (10 years)  | Higher     |

**Analysis**: Run all three scenarios and compare the asset balance curves. The "best" strategy depends on:
- Life expectancy (break-even typically around age 80-84)
- Risk tolerance (early markets crashes hurt delayed strategies more)
- Other income sources
- Health considerations

## üè• Social Security Disability Decision Analysis

For those with health issues, SSDI can be life-changing financially.

### Scenario A: SSDI Approved

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "SSDI Approved",
    "notes": "Tom gets SSDI at 58: $2,600/month (full retirement amount) immediately, converts to regular SS at 67. Financial game-changer."
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 5200,
    "duration_months": 300
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "SSDI",
      "amount": 2600,
      "start_month": 6,

      "start_month": 108
    }
  ],
  "assets": [

    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Savings",
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "401k",
      "order": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scenario B: SSDI Denied, Early Retirement at 62

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "SSDI Denied - Early SS at 62", 
    "notes": "Tom's SSDI denied. Must survive 4 years on assets alone, then reduced SS benefit ($1,950 = 75% of full). Much harder path."
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 5200,
    "duration_months": 300
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security (Early)",
      "amount": 1950,
      "start_month": 48
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "401k",
      "type": "taxable", 
      "balance": 180000,
      "interest_rate": 0.055,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Savings",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 45000,
      "interest_rate": 0.02,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Savings",
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "401k",
      "order": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scenario C: SSDI Denied, Part-Time Work Bridge

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "SSDI Denied - Part-Time Work Bridge",
    "notes": "Tom's SSDI denied but he manages part-time work ($2,200/month) until full retirement at 67. Preserves more assets."
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 5200,
    "duration_months": 300
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Part-Time Work",
      "amount": 2200,
      "start_month": 6,
      "stop_month": 107
    },
    {
      "name": "Social Security (Full)",
      "amount": 2600,
      "start_month": 108
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "401k",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 180000,
      "interest_rate": 0.055,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Savings", 
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 45000,
      "interest_rate": 0.02,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Savings",
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "401k",
      "order": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Insights:**
- **SSDI approval** = getting your full Social Security benefit 9 years early (huge financial win)
- **SSDI denial** forces difficult choices: reduced benefits or continued work with health limitations
- **Application process** takes 6+ months of living on assets

---

## üåâ Early Retirement Bridge Strategies

Want to retire before Social Security? You need a bridge strategy.

### Bridge Strategy: Conservative Asset Allocation

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Early Retirement Bridge - Bond Tent Strategy", 
    "notes": "Shift to conservative assets during early retirement to reduce sequence-of-returns risk. Bonds first, then stocks, preserve 401k growth."
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 6000,
    "duration_months": 240
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Social Security",
      "amount": 2800,
      "start_month": 84
    }
  ],
  "assets": [

      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "Conservative Stocks",
      "order": 2
    },
    {
      "account": "401k (Aggressive)",
      "order": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

## üíº Complex Real-World Scenario

Let's put it all together with a realistic layoff situation.

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Real-World: Early Retirement After Layoff",
    "notes": "Dave, 60, laid off 7 weeks ago. Evaluating early retirement vs job hunting. Includes bridge consulting, multiple asset types, future car expense."
  },
  "plan": {
    "monthly_expenses": 7500,
    "duration_months": 300
  },
  "income": [
    {
      "name": "Consulting Work",
      "amount": 3000,
      "start_month": 6,
      "stop_month": 18
    },
    {
      "name": "Social Security",
      "amount": 2400,
      "start_month": 24
    }
  ],
  "assets": [
    {
      "name": "Emergency Fund",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 40000,
      "interest_rate": 0.01,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Taxable Investments", 
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 450000,
      "interest_rate": 0.055,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Traditional 401k",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": 380000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Roth IRA",
      "type": "tax_free", 
      "balance": 75000,
      "interest_rate": 0.06,
      "compounding": "monthly"
    },
    {
      "name": "Car Replacement",
      "type": "taxable",
      "balance": -35000,
      "start_month": 84
    }
  ],
  "order": [
    {
      "account": "Emergency Fund",
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "account": "Taxable Investments",
      "order": 2
    }, 
    {
      "account": "Traditional 401k",
      "order": 3
    },
    {
      "account": "Roth IRA",
      "order": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

**This models:**
- **Immediate situation**: Living off emergency fund initially
- **Bridge income**: Some consulting for 1 year to ease transition  
- **Social Security timing**: Starting at 62 (realistic for layoff situation)
- **Asset priority**: Tax-efficient withdrawal sequence
- **Future expense**: Car replacement in 7 years
- **Growth assumptions**: Different rates for different asset types

## üéØ How to Use This Guide

### 1. Start Simple
Copy the Level 1 scenario and modify the numbers to match your basic situation.

### 2. Add Complexity Gradually
- Level 2: Add your income sources (Social Security, pensions, part-time work)

- Level 4: Add windfalls and major expenses

### 3. Compare Scenarios
Create variants to test:
- Different Social Security timing
- SSDI approval vs denial
- Various bridge strategies
- Optimistic vs pessimistic market returns

### 4. Stress Test
- What if returns are 2% lower?
- What if expenses are $500/month higher?
- What if a market crash happens in year 2-3?

### 5. Make Informed Decisions
Use the insights to:
- Choose Social Security timing
- Plan withdrawal strategies
- Build appropriate emergency reserves
- Decide on early retirement feasibility

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Everything is an asset** - Windfalls, expenses, future accounts can all be modeled as assets with timing and growth properties

2. **Timing matters enormously** - Small changes in Social Security timing or income duration can extend financial runway by years

3. **Withdrawal order affects outcomes** - Tax-efficient strategies preserve wealth longer

4. **Early years are critical** - Sequence of returns risk means early market crashes hurt more than later ones

5. **Income trumps assets** - Even small amounts of reliable income dramatically improve sustainability

## üöß Limitations to Remember

This tool shows **cash flow projections**, but doesn't model:
- **Tax implications** (withdrawals shown gross, not net)
- **Inflation** (expenses stay constant in real dollars)
- **Market volatility** (returns are smoothed monthly)
- **Required minimum distributions**
- **Healthcare cost changes**
- **Longevity uncertainty**

Use these scenarios as a **starting point** for deeper analysis with financial professionals.
